### Labels

When you open an [issue](https://github.com/erming/shout/issues) or send us a
[PR](https://github.com/erming/shout/pulls), it will most likely be given one or
several labels. Here is what they mean:

- **bug**: Issues that report and PRs that solve any defects that cause
  unexpected behaviors.
- **documentation**: Tickets that mention a lack of documentation, suggest their
  improvement, or PRs that address these.
- **duplicate**: Tickets already solved in the past or already open. Such
  tickets should always link to the previous one on the subject.
- **enhancement**: Tickets that describe a desired feature or PRs that add them
  to the project.
- **help wanted**: Tickets that we would like the community to help us with, by
  either answering questions or send us PRs.
- **priority**: Tickets that the core team deemed critical and PRs that the core
  team should look at before others.
- **question**: Tickets that are actually support cases.
- **wontfix**: Tickets that, after discussion and explanation, will not be fixed
  or implemented.
